# Lunar-Surface-Mapping-using-Transfer-Learning

This repository contains code and data for a project that uses transfer learning to map the lunar surface. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that involves using a pre-trained neural network as a starting point for a new task.

## Project structure


Dataset : [Lunar Rocky Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romainpessia/artificial-lunar-rocky-landscape-dataset)

Models: This directory contains pre-trained models that are used for transfer learning. The pre-trained models were trained on a large dataset of natural images and are used as a starting point for training a new model on lunar surface images.

Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use transfer learning for lunar surface mapping. The notebooks show how to load a pre-trained model, fine-tune it on lunar surface images, and use it to predict the labels of new images.
